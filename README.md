There's not really much to this. It's pretty bare bones to meet the criteria of the assignment since I don't intend to use this after this assignment. Mostly just put stuff that I found amusing. In its current incarnation, this page is for module 5 of my Version Control class at Boise State University and I have a more detailed template for use in industry that I worked on with a friend so it's not permissable for this assignment.
